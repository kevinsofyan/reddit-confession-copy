ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WAS AROUND OR CAME OUT!!!!!! and this happen on a kinda busy road!!  i go pick it up and just leave at there door step . I never called the cops or filed insurance . i fixed the car out of pocket sadly . that day lives with me forever because i pass by that road every single day . \neverything eventually got fixed i guess the city fixed it or something . idk how i didn’t get caught . when i parked i parked at a gas station so the cameras had to have gotten my plates im guessing . i remember it even came out on the local news and newspaper what happened asking people in our town  that if they knew anything to call the city . i was scared for weeks . i never got caught with anything just continued living my ordinary life . \n\nTo anyone who works night shift , always be super careful heading home . If you literally can’t stay awake just call someone or park somewhere safe and take a nap . don’t be dumb like me",

              "My mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings. I live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday. I'm still in a huge debt due to my mom's cancer treatments for two years. I'm a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but I seriously only have around 20 dollars in my name. I'm desperate and don't know what to do, we don't have any relatives or friends that could help us.\n\nRecently, our company hosted a donation drive for Christmas and I received around 200 dollars (enough to get me and my siblings through). I have it with me right now but I'm still debating if I should use it or not. The company won't be able to track it because these were all given to me anonymously in cash but I still feel bad. I know it would help my family so much but I can't stomach thinking that if my mom could see me right now doing what I'm doing, she'd be disgusted of me.\n\nEdit: each employee is responsible of collecting the donations and I was able to collect the 200 dollars. The donation drive was not connected to my current living situation but for christmas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Thank you, everyone for talking me out of it. I haven't been myself these past few days but I'll do my best  to hang on for my little family. I'll turn the donations in first thing tomorrow and try to talk to my landlord. You were all so kind to a stranger. I never knew how much I needed it until now. ",

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings. I live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday. I&amp;#39;m still in a huge debt due to my mom&amp;#39;s cancer treatments for two years. I&amp;#39;m a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but I seriously only have around 20 dollars in my name. I&amp;#39;m desperate and don&amp;#39;t know what to do, we don&amp;#39;t have any relatives or friends that could help us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, our company hosted a donation drive for Christmas and I received around 200 dollars (enough to get me and my siblings through). I have it with me right now but I&amp;#39;m still debating if I should use it or not. The company won&amp;#39;t be able to track it because these were all given to me anonymously in cash but I still feel bad. I know it would help my family so much but I can&amp;#39;t stomach thinking that if my mom could see me right now doing what I&amp;#39;m doing, she&amp;#39;d be disgusted of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: each employee is responsible of collecting the donations and I was able to collect the 200 dollars. The donation drive was not connected to my current living situation but for christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: Thank you, everyone for talking me out of it. I haven&amp;#39;t been myself these past few days but I&amp;#39;ll do my best  to hang on for my little family. I&amp;#39;ll turn the donations in first thing tomorrow and try to talk to my landlord. You were all so kind to a stranger. I never knew how much I needed it until now. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

I got off the highway, and went to a gas station to get gas and poop. we went in paid for gas and i tried to poop but someone was in the bathroom. Went outside and pumped gas and afterwards i went back inside but the bathroom was still locked. At this moment it was do or die, it felt like holding it in was an olympic sport. There was a KFC right next to this gas station so i go drive my car there and park. Immediately i run inside leaving the car running with my girlfriend inside. I run towards the bathroom and the stall was out of order and in this moment i had to make a decision to A) poo my pants or B) poop in the broken toilet. I went back to my car with clean pants and my girlfriend noticed i looked disgruntled. she asked me what was wrong and i said "i just pooped in a toilet that was out of order and now some kfc employee is gonna have to clean my poo out of a toilet" i almost started crying.

              "When I was 14 my dad got me a ps4, but I had no games to play. So I used to spend a lot of my time playing a free BETA game online called PlayStation Home. It’s basically kinda like the game Sims, but online. Everything is virtual but you pay real money to buy virtual things like clothes, special customizations, house, apartment, etc. You can also interact with people all over the world in public virtual areas. When you type a little bubble appears above your avatar’s head in which anyone can see nearby. \n\nAnyway I was using a girl avatar to troll and I met this Arabic man who was in his 30s who claimed to be rich. At first he was teaching me Arabic language. Then it escalated to this weird Dom /Sub kink that he had. I had no idea what any of that meant when I was a teen but he wanted me to call him master and make my avatar do certain gestures and in return he would buy me Psn Cards, usually $50 cards. They are like gift cards which you redeem the code and can buy things for PlayStation so he basically just sent me the code. Sometimes he would tell me how to spend the Psn cards, like what outfits to buy for my avatar which were usually skimpy outfits. I did everything he asked I was just excited to download digital games from the Psn cards that he would give me. I did however spent most of his money on PlayStation Home content. This went on for a long time. Eventually I stopped spending so much time in that virtual world as I got older and wanted real life experiences. I eventually stopped signing online in PlayStation. But I found out years after that PlayStation Home closed way back in 2015, and it’s crazy thinking about it because thousands of users were active and spent a lot of time and money on that game which they can’t play anymore. I regret what I did to get Psn cards, even though it was all just in that virtual game.",

It’s even more painful because I was never caught and the elders still treat me like some sweet little girl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sinned in God’s home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

And that was only my moms text, I blocked the guy on her phone and she confronted me about it. I then told her about the messages i saw and whatnot. Now im ignoring her while she blames only me without saying anything. and im left constantly imagining it in my head, being angry at her and sad. i regret my actions and i wish i never looked. what a day',

But today i was on a call with my dad and after we hung up i went through her snap out of curiosity, and saw horrible messages i feel disgusted by like for exsample &amp;quot;i am so boring that i only let you c*m in my mouth&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Youre so hot&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Meet up again at 8pm?&amp;quot; + more. And that was only my moms text, I blocked the guy on her phone and she confronted me about it. I then told her about the messages i saw and whatnot. Now im ignoring her while she blames only me without saying anything. and im left constantly imagining it in my head, being angry at her and sad. i regret my actions and i wish i never looked. what a day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

              "I don’t know how to tell my therapist i had sex as a 16 year old. I lost my virginity this summer and regret it truly and have prayed so much since then, as I’ve grown up being taught that sex is bad and am in a community where having sex is a huge scandal, and means you are a whore. This has been on my mind and taken a toll on me as the guy I did it with was a situationship who I did not know was taken at the time. I really don’t know why I did it, I think my loneliness took control, but I really do regret it and feel shame. I want to tell my therapist about this because it’s making me super anxious and scared. I really do wish my first time was more special than it was and with someone special and now it’s so hard to live with the fact i feel dirty and stupid for losing it so soon, especially with the loser guy i did it with. I’m scared my therapist will think differently of me, especially because i told her i never did anything with this guy and because i really regret it and i don’t want her to judge me because i feel like this will definitely make me look bad. I really cant talk about this with anyone i know so i sort of have to suffer in silence about it. I’m scared anyone i know will even find this, i’m so upset i lost my innocence to someone i don’t even speak to anymore and i feel horrible, especially with the fact he was taken and now there is drama with the girl, that’s also causing me so much anxiety that it causes me to throw up. My therapist is a nice and sweet lady, i don’t think she would judge me, but i’ve already made points to her about how people always make rumors about me (which is true) and i don’t want her to start agreeing with those people and for me to make myself look bad to her. \nalso not to mention he told his friends and i just get so paranoid everyone around me knows and obviously i’ll deny it to anyone who asks but this pressure is literally too much\n\nedit: this is my first post and i literally would’ve never expected to go on reddit of all places to talk about this (or anything in general) but thank you so much for the kind people helping me understand better i appreciate it so much it’s genuinely helping a lot ❤️i also am aware of cultural purity and i usually am against all of that (as i don’t take religion in a cult like way but i still consider myself catholic because it is also apart of my culture)\n\nUPDATE!!!: i told my therapist about it and she was honestly so sweet about it and so understanding and she helped me out so much. she was not judgmental at all and told me she was 16 once too, i’m so grateful for her and all these comments ❤️",

              "a couple years back i was working a night shift job\n\nBACKSTORY\nwe’d clean stores typically 3 or 4 depending how bad they are. sometimes they were in town others close to two hours away . i typically liked waking up early for school , started at 8 but would be awake around 5 . anyways not important . i’d get home around 4:30ish and that night we had a job that was two hours away . go to work we do everything and now it’s time to head back . we’d all carpool and go from there . we get back to my friends house and i’m literally exhausted and drained. have been awake since 5am went to school then worked and it’s now around 5or 6am next day we arrive and now it’s only a matter of me heading home which is about 15 minutes away . \n\nOmw home i’m literally dazing off . nothing is keeping me awake. i even have vague memories of passing 1 or 2 stop signs and red lights . i’m less than 5 minutes from my house. i doze off so bad i lose control of the car which made me run over a stop sign which woke the hell out of me , and then run into a mailbox and later into a street light . the entire front car was damaged. i park the car and get out and panicking not knowing what to do . the mailbox stand is all bend and the physical mailbox is halfway across the street . ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WAS AROUND OR CAME OUT!!!!!! and this happen on a kinda busy road!!  i go pick it up and just leave at there door step . I never called the cops or filed insurance . i fixed the car out of pocket sadly . that day lives with me forever because i pass by that road every single day . \neverything eventually got fixed i guess the city fixed it or something . idk how i didn’t get caught . when i parked i parked at a gas station so the cameras had to have gotten my plates im guessing . i remember it even came out on the local news and newspaper what happened asking people in our town  that if they knew anything to call the city . i was scared for weeks . i never got caught with anything just continued living my ordinary life . \n\nTo anyone who works night shift , always be super careful heading home . If you literally can’t stay awake just call someone or park somewhere safe and take a nap . don’t be dumb like me",

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;a couple years back i was working a night shift job&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BACKSTORY\nwe’d clean stores typically 3 or 4 depending how bad they are. sometimes they were in town others close to two hours away . i typically liked waking up early for school , started at 8 but would be awake around 5 . anyways not important . i’d get home around 4:30ish and that night we had a job that was two hours away . go to work we do everything and now it’s time to head back . we’d all carpool and go from there . we get back to my friends house and i’m literally exhausted and drained. have been awake since 5am went to school then worked and it’s now around 5or 6am next day we arrive and now it’s only a matter of me heading home which is about 15 minutes away . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Omw home i’m literally dazing off . nothing is keeping me awake. i even have vague memories of passing 1 or 2 stop signs and red lights . i’m less than 5 minutes from my house. i doze off so bad i lose control of the car which made me run over a stop sign which woke the hell out of me , and then run into a mailbox and later into a street light . the entire front car was damaged. i park the car and get out and panicking not knowing what to do . the mailbox stand is all bend and the physical mailbox is halfway across the street . ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WAS AROUND OR CAME OUT!!!!!! and this happen on a kinda busy road!!  i go pick it up and just leave at there door step . I never called the cops or filed insurance . i fixed the car out of pocket sadly . that day lives with me forever because i pass by that road every single day . \neverything eventually got fixed i guess the city fixed it or something . idk how i didn’t get caught . when i parked i parked at a gas station so the cameras had to have gotten my plates im guessing . i remember it even came out on the local news and newspaper what happened asking people in our town  that if they knew anything to call the city . i was scared for weeks . i never got caught with anything just continued living my ordinary life . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To anyone who works night shift , always be super careful heading home . If you literally can’t stay awake just call someone or park somewhere safe and take a nap . don’t be dumb like me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

              "My mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings. I live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday. I'm still in a huge debt due to my mom's cancer treatments for two years. I'm a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but I seriously only have around 20 dollars in my name. I'm desperate and don't know what to do, we don't have any relatives or friends that could help us.\n\nRecently, our company hosted a donation drive for Christmas and I received around 200 dollars (enough to get me and my siblings through). I have it with me right now but I'm still debating if I should use it or not. The company won't be able to track it because these were all given to me anonymously in cash but I still feel bad. I know it would help my family so much but I can't stomach thinking that if my mom could see me right now doing what I'm doing, she'd be disgusted of me.\n\nEdit: each employee is responsible of collecting the donations and I was able to collect the 200 dollars. The donation drive was not connected to my current living situation but for christmas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Thank you, everyone for talking me out of it. I haven't been myself these past few days but I'll do my best  to hang on for my little family. I'll turn the donations in first thing tomorrow and try to talk to my landlord. You were all so kind to a stranger. I never knew how much I needed it until now. ",

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings. I live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday. I&amp;#39;m still in a huge debt due to my mom&amp;#39;s cancer treatments for two years. I&amp;#39;m a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but I seriously only have around 20 dollars in my name. I&amp;#39;m desperate and don&amp;#39;t know what to do, we don&amp;#39;t have any relatives or friends that could help us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently, our company hosted a donation drive for Christmas and I received around 200 dollars (enough to get me and my siblings through). I have it with me right now but I&amp;#39;m still debating if I should use it or not. The company won&amp;#39;t be able to track it because these were all given to me anonymously in cash but I still feel bad. I know it would help my family so much but I can&amp;#39;t stomach thinking that if my mom could see me right now doing what I&amp;#39;m doing, she&amp;#39;d be disgusted of me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: each employee is responsible of collecting the donations and I was able to collect the 200 dollars. The donation drive was not connected to my current living situation but for christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update: Thank you, everyone for talking me out of it. I haven&amp;#39;t been myself these past few days but I&amp;#39;ll do my best  to hang on for my little family. I&amp;#39;ll turn the donations in first thing tomorrow and try to talk to my landlord. You were all so kind to a stranger. I never knew how much I needed it until now. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

Me and my girlfriend (22f) were heading home from a grocery store 2 towns over. On the way back i felt the unsettling chirp from the devil himself through my butthole. I got off the highway, and went to a gas station to get gas and poop. we went in paid for gas and i tried to poop but someone was in the bathroom. Went outside and pumped gas and afterwards i went back inside but the bathroom was still locked. At this moment it was do or die, it felt like holding it in was an olympic sport. There was a KFC right next to this gas station so i go drive my car there and park. Immediately i run inside leaving the car running with my girlfriend inside. I run towards the bathroom and the stall was out of order and in this moment i had to make a decision to A) poo my pants or B) poop in the broken toilet. I went back to my car with clean pants and my girlfriend noticed i looked disgruntled. she asked me what was wrong and i said "i just pooped in a toilet that was out of order and now some kfc employee is gonna have to clean my poo out of a toilet" i almost started crying. This was about 4-6 months ago and it always lingers in the back of my mind. And to the KFC employee that had to clean that 6 minute long monster turd, im sorry.',

I picked it up and checked the numbers on the card and it told me there was $400 in funds. I could’ve and should’ve given it back to them. I have no idea why I didn’t do it. I guess because I’m struggling financially but that doesn’t justify my actions. I feel guilty even looking at it and I don’t want to use it but I’m so paranoid that I’m going to get horrible karma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I’ve posted on my local and tourist facebook groups and Craigslist about the card. No inquires yet. I’ll update if anyone claims it :/&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

              "When I was 14 my dad got me a ps4, but I had no games to play. So I used to spend a lot of my time playing a free BETA game online called PlayStation Home. It’s basically kinda like the game Sims, but online. Everything is virtual but you pay real money to buy virtual things like clothes, special customizations, house, apartment, etc. You can also interact with people all over the world in public virtual areas. When you type a little bubble appears above your avatar’s head in which anyone can see nearby. \n\nAnyway I was using a girl avatar to troll and I met this Arabic man who was in his 30s who claimed to be rich. At first he was teaching me Arabic language. Then it escalated to this weird Dom /Sub kink that he had. I had no idea what any of that meant when I was a teen but he wanted me to call him master and make my avatar do certain gestures and in return he would buy me Psn Cards, usually $50 cards. They are like gift cards which you redeem the code and can buy things for PlayStation so he basically just sent me the code. Sometimes he would tell me how to spend the Psn cards, like what outfits to buy for my avatar which were usually skimpy outfits. I did everything he asked I was just excited to download digital games from the Psn cards that he would give me. I did however spent most of his money on PlayStation Home content. This went on for a long time. Eventually I stopped spending so much time in that virtual world as I got older and wanted real life experiences. I eventually stopped signing online in PlayStation. But I found out years after that PlayStation Home closed way back in 2015, and it’s crazy thinking about it because thousands of users were active and spent a lot of time and money on that game which they can’t play anymore. I regret what I did to get Psn cards, even though it was all just in that virtual game.",

              "I don’t know how to tell my therapist i had sex as a 16 year old. I lost my virginity this summer and regret it truly and have prayed so much since then, as I’ve grown up being taught that sex is bad and am in a community where having sex is a huge scandal, and means you are a whore. This has been on my mind and taken a toll on me as the guy I did it with was a situationship who I did not know was taken at the time. I really don’t know why I did it, I think my loneliness took control, but I really do regret it and feel shame. I want to tell my therapist about this because it’s making me super anxious and scared. I really do wish my first time was more special than it was and with someone special and now it’s so hard to live with the fact i feel dirty and stupid for losing it so soon, especially with the loser guy i did it with. I’m scared my therapist will think differently of me, especially because i told her i never did anything with this guy and because i really regret it and i don’t want her to judge me because i feel like this will definitely make me look bad. I really cant talk about this with anyone i know so i sort of have to suffer in silence about it. I’m scared anyone i know will even find this, i’m so upset i lost my innocence to someone i don’t even speak to anymore and i feel horrible, especially with the fact he was taken and now there is drama with the girl, that’s also causing me so much anxiety that it causes me to throw up. My therapist is a nice and sweet lady, i don’t think she would judge me, but i’ve already made points to her about how people always make rumors about me (which is true) and i don’t want her to start agreeing with those people and for me to make myself look bad to her. \nalso not to mention he told his friends and i just get so paranoid everyone around me knows and obviously i’ll deny it to anyone who asks but this pressure is literally too much\n\nedit: this is my first post and i literally would’ve never expected to go on reddit of all places to talk about this (or anything in general) but thank you so much for the kind people helping me understand better i appreciate it so much it’s genuinely helping a lot ❤️i also am aware of cultural purity and i usually am against all of that (as i don’t take religion in a cult like way but i still consider myself catholic because it is also apart of my culture)\n\nUPDATE!!!: i told my therapist about it and she was honestly so sweet about it and so understanding and she helped me out so much. she was not judgmental at all and told me she was 16 once too, i’m so grateful for her and all these comments ❤️",

I dont remember what went through my head when I decided to quickly pick it up and stuff it into my pocket before she reached her seat and turn around.\nI could think of two reasons why I did it. first, it was probably cuz there was a small candy shop across the street that I never had any money to buy anything. second was cuz if the fact that I didn\'t really my 3rd grade teacher. she was mean and turned my entire world of math upside. I mean I had just perfected addition and subtraction and now you\'re gonna kick the plus sign over and ambush the minus sign with two periods AND give us a  worksheet of 50 problems of "multipliwhat"? and "divihuh"?...I sat there just completely confused. I didn\'t even know these things existed. soooo what I did was just take the two numbers and put them side by side as my answer and turned it in. I got my results back and whaddya know I got one correct!........ 0x0=00....👍',

I dont remember what went through my head when I decided to quickly pick it up and stuff it into my pocket before she reached her seat and turn around.\nI could think of two reasons why I did it. first, it was probably cuz there was a small candy shop across the street that I never had any money to buy anything. second was cuz if the fact that I didn&amp;#39;t really my 3rd grade teacher. she was mean and turned my entire world of math upside. I mean I had just perfected addition and subtraction and now you&amp;#39;re gonna kick the plus sign over and ambush the minus sign with two periods AND give us a  worksheet of 50 problems of &amp;quot;multipliwhat&amp;quot;? and &amp;quot;divihuh&amp;quot;?...I sat there just completely confused. I didn&amp;#39;t even know these things existed. soooo what I did was just take the two numbers and put them side by side as my answer and turned it in. I got my results back and whaddya know I got one correct!........ 0x0=00....👍&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

              "When I was around 11 years old one of my younger friends who was around 8 or 9 came to my house for a sleepover. She had this beautiful turquoise bracelet that I instantly fell in love with. I asked her if I could trade it for one of my toys but she said no. I offered her other things I had and practically BEGGED her. She still said no, because her grandma had given it to her. The morning, while she was in the bathroom I grabbed the bracelet from her stuff and hid it in between my bed and my nightstand. I planned to steal it because I wanted it SO bad. A few hours later when her mom came to pick her up she went to grab her things and began frantically looking for it. My guilt kicked in so I started helping her “look” for it and then magically found it in my hiding spot. I told her it must have fallen off my nightstand in between the bed and she never thought anything of it. To this day I still am so glad I gave it back because she ended up moving away, I never saw her again after that which meant I never would’ve had the chance to give it back.",

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was around 11 years old one of my younger friends who was around 8 or 9 came to my house for a sleepover. She had this beautiful turquoise bracelet that I instantly fell in love with. I asked her if I could trade it for one of my toys but she said no. I offered her other things I had and practically BEGGED her. She still said no, because her grandma had given it to her. The morning, while she was in the bathroom I grabbed the bracelet from her stuff and hid it in between my bed and my nightstand. I planned to steal it because I wanted it SO bad. A few hours later when her mom came to pick her up she went to grab her things and began frantically looking for it. My guilt kicked in so I started helping her “look” for it and then magically found it in my hiding spot. I told her it must have fallen off my nightstand in between the bed and she never thought anything of it. To this day I still am so glad I gave it back because she ended up moving away, I never saw her again after that which meant I never would’ve had the chance to give it back.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

We were going down a winding road and my car slipped into a ditch. Just so happened it was close to where there was some heavy machinery. Went to see what we could use to pull a car out of a ditch and found a truck. Keys were in it and after some efforts and smart maneuvering we were able to get my car out of the ditch. Truck returned no harm no foul... right? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

One of my girlfriends befriended the same guy and they became super good friends. They would talk ALL THE TIME and ultimately I grew jealous thinking she was trying to steal him from me. My last straw was when I saw them exchanging gifts. After this, I started stealing her belongings (her family travelled quite often so she had a lot of keychains from different countries and some sentimental things as well) from her school bag and either throwing them in the trash or taking them home as an act of “revenge”. A few days later, my mom saw a keychain of hers in my bag which was of a country we had never visited. I told her I must’ve accidentally put it in my bag and promised to return it to her and threw it in the trash the next day. I never apologised to her and she never found out that I was behind all of this, but I still feel terrible thinking about it.",

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happened all the way back in my 3rd year of elementary school. I had a crush on this guy and we were somewhat good friends. One of my girlfriends befriended the same guy and they became super good friends. They would talk ALL THE TIME and ultimately I grew jealous thinking she was trying to steal him from me. My last straw was when I saw them exchanging gifts. After this, I started stealing her belongings (her family travelled quite often so she had a lot of keychains from different countries and some sentimental things as well) from her school bag and either throwing them in the trash or taking them home as an act of “revenge”. A few days later, my mom saw a keychain of hers in my bag which was of a country we had never visited. I told her I must’ve accidentally put it in my bag and promised to return it to her and threw it in the trash the next day. I never apologised to her and she never found out that I was behind all of this, but I still feel terrible thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

Now when I got the boots nothing seemed off, I thought they looked quite normal and clean looking on the outside so I didnt bother trying them on.\n\nWhen we got home, that's when I found out how wrong I was. Thank god I didn't put the boots on. My dad did... He felt something squishy and disgusting on his feet so he dumped the contents of the boots and then we saw. There were baby rats ***(mice? sorry english isn't my first language)*** inside each boot. Im not talking like 2-3 baby rats. There were ALOT. Maybe like 40-50 in total? They looked like they had just been born. It was so horrifying and nasty. Some freaking rat had turned it into a nest of sorts.\n\nMy dad immidiately thought about killing the rats and getting rid of them but I coudn't do it. No matter how disgusting they were I still felt bad for them their mother was probaly frantically looking for them but my dad insisted. Of course I did not listen and I decided to dump the mice on the shallow part of neighborhood's canal system hoping they would survive. I told my dad I had dumped them into the canal to drown them but I lied.\n\nNow I forgot about this entire incident and I have even worn the boots on several occasions but recently, I noticed a few rats scurrying around the neghborhood. These rats we huge!! Not new york city levels but still pretty huge. They were as big as kittens. I thought nothing of it but then I heard several neighbors complaining how there were rats inside their homes and that's when I connected the dots and realized those rats might have been the same ones I dumped a month ago.\n\nAnd thats pretty much it. I live in a nicer area so our neighborhood was pretty clean up until those rats started scurrying around the streets. In the garbage and in people's houses. Even our house was no exception, my mom screamed in the early hours of the morning and that's when I knew they had invaded our house as well. People were getting mad and complaining and I am horrified. The local government unit has already become involved and I think this is becoming a very big issue...\n\nTHE RATS ARE EVERYWHERE NOW.

I grew up in a household where the furniture would be rearranged every sunday just to make sure every spot would be clean.

              "I have a condition called Graves and it's slowly been destroying my life. I can't do the things I used to. I've been living in constant pain, but I also struggle with a rampant ED, I'm huge, overweight and struggling with restriction and emission. My doctors don't believe me though. I've been told I need to exercise and diet so I can return to a healthier weight because I have liver disfunction due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. I have a gym membership. The last time I went to the gym I collapsed on the treadmill with a HR of 210bpm and had to be carried out by my partner. I'm 245lbs, no matter what I do I cannot lose weight and I can't figure out why. I have Graves, Gastroparesis, nafld, POTs, hyper mobility in almost every joint, IBS and EOE. Eating anything makes me miserable. \n\nMy doctor told me that one of the major symptoms of Graves is rapid weight loss. In the beginning before they knew I had Graves I had gone from 270 to 215. I was extatic. Then I started taking my meds and started ballooning up again. So I stopped. I was on a weight loss drug and it really helped silence the food talk in my head and I was able to eat and was happy but then my insurance denied a refill because they don't cover weight loss meds. I don't know what to do. I can't look at my meds and now even when I take them I involuntarily throw them up. \n\nMy endocrinologist told me I might need to have my thyroid removed because my levels are so dangerous they're doing damage to my heart. But if I have my thyroid removed I'll have hypothyroidism and I'll get even fatter. Idk what to do. I'm so scared. It took 2 years to get a Gastroparesis diagnosis because I was fat. I didn't get a Graves diagnosis until I collapsed at work and the hospital doctor ran tests and caught it. My primary care doctor told me she didn't want to run tests for hyperthyroidism because I was fat and being skinny is a symptom of it. I have so much wrong with me. I live in constant pain, can hardly eat even when I want to, am constantly vomiting even when I don't want to and I'm scared that if I don't lose weight I'm going to die from some condition they never thought to check for because I'm fat. Idk what to do. I'm terrified.",

I&amp;#39;ve been living in constant pain, but I also struggle with a rampant ED, I&amp;#39;m huge, overweight and struggling with restriction and emission. My doctors don&amp;#39;t believe me though. I&amp;#39;ve been told I need to exercise and diet so I can return to a healthier weight because I have liver disfunction due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. I have a gym membership. The last time I went to the gym I collapsed on the treadmill with a HR of 210bpm and had to be carried out by my partner. I&amp;#39;m 245lbs, no matter what I do I cannot lose weight and I can&amp;#39;t figure out why. I have Graves, Gastroparesis, nafld, POTs, hyper mobility in almost every joint, IBS and EOE. Eating anything makes me miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My doctor told me that one of the major symptoms of Graves is rapid weight loss. In the beginning before they knew I had Graves I had gone from 270 to 215. I was extatic. Then I started taking my meds and started ballooning up again. So I stopped. I was on a weight loss drug and it really helped silence the food talk in my head and I was able to eat and was happy but then my insurance denied a refill because they don&amp;#39;t cover weight loss meds. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I can&amp;#39;t look at my meds and now even when I take them I involuntarily throw them up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My endocrinologist told me I might need to have my thyroid removed because my levels are so dangerous they&amp;#39;re doing damage to my heart. But if I have my thyroid removed I&amp;#39;ll have hypothyroidism and I&amp;#39;ll get even fatter. Idk what to do. I&amp;#39;m so scared. It took 2 years to get a Gastroparesis diagnosis because I was fat. I didn&amp;#39;t get a Graves diagnosis until I collapsed at work and the hospital doctor ran tests and caught it. My primary care doctor told me she didn&amp;#39;t want to run tests for hyperthyroidism because I was fat and being skinny is a symptom of it. I have so much wrong with me. I live in constant pain, can hardly eat even when I want to, am constantly vomiting even when I don&amp;#39;t want to and I&amp;#39;m scared that if I don&amp;#39;t lose weight I&amp;#39;m going to die from some condition they never thought to check for because I&amp;#39;m fat. Idk what to do. I&amp;#39;m terrified.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

              "I'm not 100% sure this fits here, but I'll explain anyway. If it gets removed, so be it.\n\nAlmost two weeks ago, I was at my brother's birthday party. We had invited the next door neighbor, among others, to come, have some lunch, and celebrate. Neighbors friend was there visiting, so we invited him too. At one point, the neighbor, his friend, and I, were just sitting around bantering, laughing, and just joking around for the most part. At some point I got distracted with party duties, and stopped following the conversation, but didn't want to appear rude so I sort of half chuckled, when I thought neighbor, and friend were telling a joke.\n\nWell, somewhere along the line, the conversation turned from jokes and good vibes to neighbor's friend mentioning his sick wife having just had an operation, and taking a turn for the worse. I didn't quite pick up on this change of mood until I laughed at what I thought was going to be the setup for a joke, which just turned out to be this guys wife being in agony. Needless to say, I fucked up, and these guys left the party shortly after. I hoped to God that they didn't hear me, and this wouldn't affect good relations with them, but after seeing them on Christmas Eve, and meeting the wife in question, who, if looks could kill, would have ended me in a heartbeat. I can safely say that they definitely picked up on my laughter, and now I will forever be known as that asshole who laughed at the suffering of a woman battling cancer. I just hope that I haven't also caused problems for the rest of my family now.\n\nEdit: for the people who suggest apologizing, I hope I get a chance to do so. Something I didn't mention earlier in my post is that I live interstate, and i'm only visiting family for birthday/Christmas/New Year's. Then heading back to my normal life in early January.

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other week I was in the store and had a booger that was really bothering me. I was walking around the ailes trying to not think about it but it made breathing really annoying. I was over it. So I decided to swipe my nose a few times to try and get it out. I got it out and initially waited until it was dry enough to flick off onto the ground outside. But I got impatient and realized that I was about to be next in line to check out and didn&amp;#39;t want to accidentally hand a booger to the cashier. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I found a price tag (the kind that hangs over the edge of a shelf) and swiped it back there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

              "I am a 15 year old girl. I have been struggling with social anxiety for the last couple years. Recently, the social anxiety has taken control of my life, affecting not only myself but my family as well.  \nAbout 2 months ago, I was having an especially hard day at weight training for my sport. I convinced my mom I was going to throw up. Conveniently, my older sister had just come home from school with a 24-48 hour stomach bug. I faked catching this as well, just thinking that everyone fakes being sick at some point. I could only think to myself, \"just one more day,\" after a couple days I learned to vomit on command. I knew I shouldn't do that, it can have serious long term effects. I can't stop now. My mom still thinks I am sick. I can't stand being full. I can't do it.  \nNow my mom has been very worried about me, calling every pediatrician she knows. I have had countless uncomfortable tests since then, including blood draws, urine tests, breath tests, celiac test, and even an endoscopy (for anyone that doesn't know, that requires anesthesia.) I thought that's this would steer me away from continuing to pretend I have this illness. Now I have done hours of research abt the sickness to simulate that I have it. Im doing this all to avoid kids my own age.  \nI feel like I have gaslit myself into having symptoms. Or it's from the drugs I take everyday that I don't need. I feel extremely tired and achy. My bones are tired. I am actually vomiting everyday. I hate vomiting but I can't stop. Im so sorry.  \nNow I'm not going to pretend my family isn't well off, because we are. I feel like a privileged piece of shit with how much money my mom has spent trying to figure this out. I hate myself for it but I can't stop. I don't like how the drugs make me feel. I don't understand why Im doing this.  \nIm tired.",

              '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a 15 year old girl. I have been struggling with social anxiety for the last couple years. Recently, the social anxiety has taken control of my life, affecting not only myself but my family as well.&lt;br/&gt;\nAbout 2 months ago, I was having an especially hard day at weight training for my sport. I convinced my mom I was going to throw up. Conveniently, my older sister had just come home from school with a 24-48 hour stomach bug. I faked catching this as well, just thinking that everyone fakes being sick at some point. I could only think to myself, &amp;quot;just one more day,&amp;quot; after a couple days I learned to vomit on command. I knew I shouldn&amp;#39;t do that, it can have serious long term effects. I can&amp;#39;t stop now. My mom still thinks I am sick. I can&amp;#39;t stand being full. I can&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow my mom has been very worried about me, calling every pediatrician she knows. I have had countless uncomfortable tests since then, including blood draws, urine tests, breath tests, celiac test, and even an endoscopy (for anyone that doesn&amp;#39;t know, that requires anesthesia.) I thought that&amp;#39;s this would steer me away from continuing to pretend I have this illness. Now I have done hours of research abt the sickness to simulate that I have it. Im doing this all to avoid kids my own age.&lt;br/&gt;\nI feel like I have gaslit myself into having symptoms. Or it&amp;#39;s from the drugs I take everyday that I don&amp;#39;t need. I feel extremely tired and achy. My bones are tired. I am actually vomiting everyday. I hate vomiting but I can&amp;#39;t stop. Im so sorry.&lt;br/&gt;\nNow I&amp;#39;m not going to pretend my family isn&amp;#39;t well off, because we are. I feel like a privileged piece of shit with how much money my mom has spent trying to figure this out. I hate myself for it but I can&amp;#39;t stop. I don&amp;#39;t like how the drugs make me feel. I don&amp;#39;t understand why Im doing this.&lt;br/&gt;\nIm tired.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

So, whenever they're in town and come over for dinner, I refrain from using garlic or onions, which is frustrating because I use those two in just about everything I cook.   \n\nFor a little backstory about my step-MIL's cooking, she makes the blandest food. Once, we went to her Thanksgiving dinner. She cooked the turkey around noon, cut it up, and had it out around 3, but no one was allowed over until 5 pm. By the time we arrived, the turkey was cold AF and drier than the Sahara desert. The woman just doesn't know how to make a tasty meal.  \n\nAnyhow, my FIL visited us once without his wife, and I made chicken breast with garlic and onion seasoning, and he loved it. Nothing happened to him after he ate it. He told me that he can eat garlic and onions if they're cooked. But for some reason, when he's around his wife, both of those ingredients are not to be used.  \n\nThey visited before Christmas, and we planned a dinner at my house. My sMIL made it a point to call me to remind me not to use garlic or onions. She also called my wife to remind me not to use garlic or onions. I was so annoyed that she made it a point to remind us not to use the two ingredients after years of her constantly reminding us. That night, I cooked the chicken breast with sage, rosemary, thyme, garlic, and onion powder. Both my sMIL and FIL loved the meal.

              "When I was a teenager, my father passed away. That same year, my sibling moved away to college and my mother began dating somebody new. This was extremely hard for me as a child and I recall feeling completely alone. \n\nMy mother began inviting her boyfriend to sleep over at our home and I told her that I wasn’t ready for this, so she decided to start sleeping over at his place. I was left completely alone. I remember my mom would drop off a few frozen meals a week and then go back to her boyfriends place.\n\nI lost a significant amount of weight from not eating properly and I collapsed one day at school. My aunt picked me up from school and asked me what was going on and that was when I confessed everything to her. My aunt and uncle had a very stern talk with my mom. \n\nMy mom yelled at me and told me that I wasn’t allowed to tell anybody about what was going on at home. She would blame me and tell me that the reason our extended family doesn’t like her anymore, is because I told them what was going on. \n\nFast forward to college, my mom told me that as long as I didn’t share what was going on at home and that as long as I was nice to her boyfriend, she would pay for school. During my junior year of college, I became severely depressed. I developed an ED that impacted my ability to be physically present in class and I began failing all of my courses. I didn’t know how to tell my family, so I lied a bunch and played along as if everything was fine. I even convinced one of my friends to pretend to be a school counselor and talk to my mom.\n\nOnce graduation time came around, my mom began planning a party for me and invited all of our friends and family. I accidentally left my school login info on her computer, and she saw my grades. Everything collapsed under me, and my family began hating me. My mom kicked me out of her house, and I went to go live with my aunt and uncle. I attended a handful of family interventions, I have apologized, and I have tried to rebuild my relationships. I also went to treatment for my ED. \n\nIt has been 7 years since this happened, but it still haunts me everyday. My family doesn’t let me forget it, but I am trying my best to move on. ",

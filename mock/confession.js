            '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a government job and make 90k a year. I go into the office 1-2x a week. On these days, I get EVERYTHING done and make it look like I’m extremely busy. On the days I’m home, unless I have meetings, I don’t do shit other than house chores, watch TV, read, etc. I used to feel guilty about this, but I’m paid for my expertise and the amount of time it took me to get here. I’ve learned to be an extremely efficient worker, and so now I have a pretty great schedule. If you’re looking for something similar, I highly recommend going the government route.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

            "My mom died a year ago from breast cancer and my dad basically left me to care for my younger siblings. I live paycheck to paycheck and my credit card bank already hired a collections agency to call me everyday. I'm still in a huge debt due to my mom's cancer treatments for two years. I'm a few hundred dollars lacking for our rent but I seriously only have around 20 dollars in my name. I'm desperate and don't know what to do, we don't have any relatives or friends that could help us.\n\nRecently, our company hosted a donation drive for Christmas and I received around 200 dollars (enough to get me and my siblings through).

Me and my girlfriend (22f) were heading home from a grocery store 2 towns over. On the way back i felt the unsettling chirp from the devil himself through my butthole. I got off the highway, and went to a gas station to get gas and poop. we went in paid for gas and i tried to poop but someone was in the bathroom. Went outside and pumped gas and afterwards i went back inside but the bathroom was still locked. At this moment it was do or die, it felt like holding it in was an olympic sport. There was a KFC right next to this gas station so i go drive my car there and park. Immediately i run inside leaving the car running with my girlfriend inside. I run towards the bathroom and the stall was out of order and in this moment i had to make a decision to A) poo my pants or B) poop in the broken toilet. I went back to my car with clean pants and my girlfriend noticed i looked disgruntled. she asked me what was wrong and i said "i just pooped in a toilet that was out of order and now some kfc employee is gonna have to clean my poo out of a toilet" i almost started crying. This was about 4-6 months ago and it always lingers in the back of my mind. And to the KFC employee that had to clean that 6 minute long monster turd, im sorry.',

            "When I was 14 my dad got me a ps4, but I had no games to play. So I used to spend a lot of my time playing a free BETA game online called PlayStation Home. It’s basically kinda like the game Sims, but online. Everything is virtual but you pay real money to buy virtual things like clothes, special customizations, house, apartment, etc. You can also interact with people all over the world in public virtual areas. When you type a little bubble appears above your avatar’s head in which anyone can see nearby. \n\nAnyway I was using a girl avatar to troll and I met this Arabic man who was in his 30s who claimed to be rich. At first he was teaching me Arabic language. Then it escalated to this weird Dom /Sub kink that he had. I had no idea what any of that meant when I was a teen but he wanted me to call him master and make my avatar do certain gestures and in return he would buy me Psn Cards, usually $50 cards. They are like gift cards which you redeem the code and can buy things for PlayStation so he basically just sent me the code. Sometimes he would tell me how to spend the Psn cards, like what outfits to buy for my avatar which were usually skimpy outfits. I did everything he asked I was just excited to download digital games from the Psn cards that he would give me. I did however spent most of his money on PlayStation Home content. This went on for a long time. Eventually I stopped spending so much time in that virtual world as I got older and wanted real life experiences. I eventually stopped signing online in PlayStation. But I found out years after that PlayStation Home closed way back in 2015, and it’s crazy thinking about it because thousands of users were active and spent a lot of time and money on that game which they can’t play anymore. I regret what I did to get Psn cards, even though it was all just in that virtual game.",

            "I don’t know how to tell my therapist i had sex as a 16 year old. I lost my virginity this summer and regret it truly and have prayed so much since then, as I’ve grown up being taught that sex is bad and am in a community where having sex is a huge scandal, and means you are a whore. This has been on my mind and taken a toll on me as the guy I did it with was a situationship who I did not know was taken at the time. I really don’t know why I did it, I think my loneliness took control, but I really do regret it and feel shame. I want to tell my therapist about this because it’s making me super anxious and scared. I really do wish my first time was more special than it was and with someone special and now it’s so hard to live with the fact i feel dirty and stupid for losing it so soon, especially with the loser guy i did it with. I’m scared my therapist will think differently of me, especially because i told her i never did anything with this guy and because i really regret it and i don’t want her to judge me because i feel like this will definitely make me look bad. I really cant talk about this with anyone i know so i sort of have to suffer in silence about it. I’m scared anyone i know will even find this, i’m so upset i lost my innocence to someone i don’t even speak to anymore and i feel horrible, especially with the fact he was taken and now there is drama with the girl, that’s also causing me so much anxiety that it causes me to throw up. My therapist is a nice and sweet lady, i don’t think she would judge me, but i’ve already made points to her about how people always make rumors about me (which is true) and i don’t want her to start agreeing with those people and for me to make myself look bad to her. \nalso not to mention he told his friends and i just get so paranoid everyone around me knows and obviously i’ll deny it to anyone who asks but this pressure is literally too much\n\nedit: this is my first post and i literally would’ve never expected to go on reddit of all places to talk about this (or anything in general) but thank you so much for the kind people helping me understand better i appreciate it so much it’s genuinely helping a lot ❤️i also am aware of cultural purity and i usually am against all of that (as i don’t take religion in a cult like way but i still consider myself catholic because it is also apart of my culture)\n\nUPDATE!!!: i told my therapist about it and she was honestly so sweet about it and so understanding and she helped me out so much. she was not judgmental at all and told me she was 16 once too, i’m so grateful for her and all these comments ❤️",

            '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to tell my therapist i had sex as a 16 year old. I lost my virginity this summer and regret it truly and have prayed so much since then, as I’ve grown up being taught that sex is bad and am in a community where having sex is a huge scandal, and means you are a whore. This has been on my mind and taken a toll on me as the guy I did it with was a situationship who I did not know was taken at the time. I really don’t know why I did it, I think my loneliness took control, but I really do regret it and feel shame. I want to tell my therapist about this because it’s making me super anxious and scared. I really do wish my first time was more special than it was and with someone special and now it’s so hard to live with the fact i feel dirty and stupid for losing it so soon, especially with the loser guy i did it with. I’m scared my therapist will think differently of me, especially because i told her i never did anything with this guy and because i really regret it and i don’t want her to judge me because i feel like this will definitely make me look bad. I really cant talk about this with anyone i know so i sort of have to suffer in silence about it. I’m scared anyone i know will even find this, i’m so upset i lost my innocence to someone i don’t even speak to anymore and i feel horrible, especially with the fact he was taken and now there is drama with the girl, that’s also causing me so much anxiety that it causes me to throw up. My therapist is a nice and sweet lady, i don’t think she would judge me, but i’ve already made points to her about how people always make rumors about me (which is true) and i don’t want her to start agreeing with those people and for me to make myself look bad to her. \nalso not to mention he told his friends and i just get so paranoid everyone around me knows and obviously i’ll deny it to anyone who asks but this pressure is literally too much&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;edit: this is my first post and i literally would’ve never expected to go on reddit of all places to talk about this (or anything in general) but thank you so much for the kind people helping me understand better i appreciate it so much it’s genuinely helping a lot ❤️i also am aware of cultural purity and i usually am against all of that (as i don’t take religion in a cult like way but i still consider myself catholic because it is also apart of my culture)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;UPDATE!!!: i told my therapist about it and she was honestly so sweet about it and so understanding and she helped me out so much. she was not judgmental at all and told me she was 16 once too, i’m so grateful for her and all these comments ❤️&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

I was on the subreddit for the Dominican Republic and there was this guy who was looking for work as a driver. \n\nSince I'm a terrible human being I decided to fuck with him and send him a message saying that I was willing to hire him. I lied to him and told him that I lived in the Dominican Republic and that I was rich and owned multiple businesses. I told him that I was going to pay him well and have him as my personal chauffeur. \n\nHe seemed really excited and he asked to meet me at a McDonald's in the Dominican Republic. I said sure and the next day he texts me that he's at the McDonald's waiting for me. He sends me a picture of him waiting and I decide to block him. He was able to tell that I blocked him and he then posts that I should go to hell and that he hopes I die in the worst way possible. At the time I didn't really give a fuck but now I feel kinda guilty for doing that. I can be a horrible person sometimes I'm sorry.",

            '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day I was bored and was going through different subreddits and I happened to be on some Latin American subreddits. I was on the subreddit for the Dominican Republic and there was this guy who was looking for work as a driver. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#39;m a terrible human being I decided to fuck with him and send him a message saying that I was willing to hire him. I lied to him and told him that I lived in the Dominican Republic and that I was rich and owned multiple businesses. I told him that I was going to pay him well and have him as my personal chauffeur. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He seemed really excited and he asked to meet me at a McDonald&amp;#39;s in the Dominican Republic. I said sure and the next day he texts me that he&amp;#39;s at the McDonald&amp;#39;s waiting for me. He sends me a picture of him waiting and I decide to block him. He was able to tell that I blocked him and he then posts that I should go to hell and that he hopes I die in the worst way possible. At the time I didn&amp;#39;t really give a fuck but now I feel kinda guilty for doing that. I can be a horrible person sometimes I&amp;#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',

I offered her other things I had and practically BEGGED her. She still said no, because her grandma had given it to her.
